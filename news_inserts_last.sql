				National Energy Master Plan (NEMP).
Speaking at the Daikin Konwakai Summit in Belgium, Dr Abdullahi revealed that the ECN in collaboration with UNEP and other agencies successfully
				developed new energy standards, which were approved by the Federal Government through Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) in 2024. He noted that these standards
				would allow development of energy label for air conditioners. He then announced the highly anticipated unveiling of the Energy Efficient Cooling System in 2026, 
				a significant step towards a more sustainable future.
He acknowledged the challenges of insufficient testing materials and facilities while emphasising the government''s commitment to building the 
				nation''s capacity.
Furthermore, he explained that efforts are underway to regulate air conditioning systems and develop new frameworks for refrigeration systems, 
				which he believes will yield significant progress shortly.
Dr. Abdullahi reiterated the government''s determination to fully implement these energy standards by December 2025, assuring stakeholders 
				of the Energy Commission''s dedication to advancing sustainable and energy-efficient solutions for Nigeria.

				investment in the energy sector by foreign investors to ameliorate poverty in Africa.
He made this assertion at the ongoing Summit of the G20 Energy Transition Working Group meeting in Foz Do Iguaçu, Brazil.
The Energy expert, while speaking to delegates from across the globe underscored the important role of energy transition in achieving
				both clean affordable energy access and net-zero emissions target by 2050 in African countries, and Nigeria in particular. Dr. Abdullahi posited further
				that modern, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is critical for economic growth and the provision of access to modern energy contributes greatly 
				to improved health care, better education and economic growth in both urban and rural areas in Africa.
In his words, “One of the conclusions of the COP28 Summit held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in 2023 was the commitment of the
				participating countries to transition away from fossil fuels to renewable fuels in a just orderly and equitable manner so as to achieve net-zero emissions 
				by 2050 globally”.
While further reiterating the commitment of the Federal Government of Nigeria under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Dr. Abdullahi described
				Nigeria’s pledge to support the global initiative made at the COP28 as sacrosanct. He affirmed the country’s resolve to triple the installed capacity of 4
				renewable energy and double the rate of global energy efficiency by 2030.
Speaking to the theme of this year’s summit which is woven around “Building A Just World And A Sustainable Planet”, the Energy Commission 
				boss stressed the fact that other germane problems need to be addressed to guarantee such goal. One of such problems is the energy poverty on the African 
				continent. He emphasized the need for more energy because such is pivotal to reducing poverty, preventing diseases, and for supply of clean accessible for
				essential hygiene.
Dr. Abdullahi while alluding to Nigeria being the first African country to officially launch a detailed Energy Transition Plan (ETP) to
				address the problems of energy poverty and climate change and deliver universal access to affordable energy (SDG7) by 2030 and net-zero by 2060, the country’s
				projected estimates require that $410billion would be required to deliver improved Energy Transition Plan (ETP) by 2060.
The ECN boss concluded that finance is key to driving a clean energy transition, and this is lacking across African countries. Hence, the 
				need for foreign investors to come into the country – Nigeria which he said has a stable environment for investment to thrive. According to him, Africa is one
				of the most affected continents by climate change, and the present funding is grossly inadequate. The continent, as per Nationally Determined Contributions 
				requires about $53billion annually between year 2020 and 2035. He therefore called on G20 leaders to provide intervention in the area of adequate finance to 
				address the energy poverty militating against Africa.

				carries out the groundbreaking Ceremony for the construction of Solar PV Modules Assembly Plant at Ihunekwagu Autonomous Community AKPUGO, 
				Nkanu West LGA of Enugu State.
In his words after the ceremony, the Director General Energy Commission of Nigeria Dr Mustapha Abdullahi, who is supervised by 
				the Minister said,"The need to boost access to electricity in Nigeria cannot be overstated. Despite the country''s vast resources and potential, the
				Nigerian grid remains inefficient and inaccessible to many parts of the country. This inadequacy hampers the country''s socioeconomic development and 
				affects the quality of life for millions of Nigerians. In addressing these challenges, photovoltaic (PV) electricity emerges as a crucial solution.
				Solar energy offers a sustainable, reliable, and decentralized power source that can reach the remotest corners of our country, bringing light and hope to all."
The DG ECN reiterated that the event is a giant step towards translating the Commission''s research outputs into indigenous solutions
				that can transform the country''s energy landscape.
According to him, the assembling plant is not just a technological advancement; but also, a testament to dedication to 
				fostering home-grown innovation and self-reliance. It also perfectly aligns with the Renewed Hope Agenda of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu."
He further revealed that "Our various Research Centres across the geopolitical zones of Nigeria have been at the forefront of 
				developing demonstrable products that address energy-related problems. From bio-energy systems that could reduce over dependence on fossil fuels and 
				environmental pollution to solar drying systems that aid rural farmers in preserving their produce. Our research and development outputs are making 
				enormous impacts on our nation''s economy."
Dr. Abdullahi strongly believes that the Solar PV module assembling plant will significantly boost the Commission''s development
				capacity to domesticate the solar PV technology in Nigeria. He commended the research institutions and individuals who had hitherto made commendable
				efforts to produce PV modules with the limited resources available to them.
He further pointed out that Energy Commission under his forthright leadership is taking a major leap forward, moving from small-scale
				attempts to a full-fledged solar PV module production facility that has great potential to meet the country''s growing energy needs. This project, according 
				to the Energy expert is also a step forward for job creation and providing our youth and skilled professionals with opportunities to contribute and benefit
				from the growing renewable energy sector. The project will not only reduce the country''s overdependence on importation, but also significantly lowers the 
				cost of PV modules, making solar energy more accessible to every Nigerian household.
In appreciating the Honourable Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology, the DG said, "Your belief in this project and your 
				commitment to its success have been invaluable and extremely crucial. Your leadership has made it possible for us to reach this milestone, and we look
				forward to your continued support as we advance our renewable energy goals". He also expressed his sincere appreciation to the dedicated team at the

				realizing clean, affordable energy access and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.In his remarks the Director General of the Energy Commission
				of Nigeria (ECN), Dr Mustapha Abdullahi said, "in a world where sustainable energy is the bedrock of economic growth and societal advancement,
				Nigeria stands firm in its commitment to drive meaningful change.
At the heart of Nigeria''s dedication lies the recognition of energy''s transformative power. Access to modern, sustainable energy
				is not merely a luxury but a catalyst for improved healthcare, education, and economic prosperity across urban and rural landscapes worldwide.
Building on the momentum generated at the COP28 Summit in Dubai in 2023, Nigeria aligns itself with global efforts to shift 
				from fossil fuels to renewable sources, fostering a just and equitable transition. The ambition extends to tripling renewable energy capacity 
				and doubling global energy efficiency rates by 2030, signaling a decisive step towards a cleaner, greener future.
As a developing nation, Nigeria acknowledges its disproportionate vulnerability to climate change impacts, despite contributing
				minimally to global carbon emissions. The urgency for accelerated climate action is paramount, necessitating bold initiatives to reduce greenhouse
				gas emissions and mitigate environmental risks.
Central to Nigeria''s strategy is the pursuit of a comprehensive Energy Transition Plan, unveiled in 2021, to address energy 
				poverty and climate change while ensuring universal access to affordable energy by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2060. The plan, estimated to
				require $410 billion in investment, underscores Nigeria''s commitment to spearhead sustainable development on the African continent.
However, the journey towards a clean energy future is contingent upon accessible finance, particularly for developing nations
				like Nigeria. Despite investing a mere 2% of global renewable energy funds between 2000 and 2020, Nigeria remains resolute in its call for 
				inclusive financial mechanisms, such as debt-for-climate swaps, to accelerate clean energy adoption and achieve the objectives set forth in the
				Paris Agreement.
In conclusion, Nigeria reaffirms its dedication to the collective pursuit of a sustainable, prosperous future, grounded in clean
				energy innovation and climate resilience. Together, we can chart a path towards a brighter tomorrow for generations to come.

				air conditioners in Nigeria.
Held on November 15, 2023, the one-day training workshop on air conditioners monitoring, verification and enforcement (MVE) is an 
				integral part of the broader project, "Scaling-Up Energy-Efficient and Climate-Friendly Cooling in Nigeria" and is took place at the ECN headquarters in Abuja.
In his opening address, the Director-General ECN, Dr. Mustapha Abdullahi elucidated that the primary objective of the project is to expedite
				the transition to the use of energy-efficient air conditioners (ACs) with climate-friendly (low-GWP refrigerant) in residential, commercial and public buildings.
				This initiative aligns with Nigeria''s climate targets in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and aims to do so in a cost-effective and sustainable 
				manner.
Dr Abdullahi outlined that one of the key project activities is providing training on monitoring, verification, and enforcement (MVE) to 
				''support the implementation of upcoming minimum energy performance standards (MEPS). This training is specifically designed for relevant enforcement and 
				regulatory agencies of the government and vendors of such products.
"The main objectives of this training workshop are: to build the capacity of relevant government institutions to effectively enforce 
				energy performance standards of air conditioning equipment; to enhance their ability to carry out surveillance activities in the air conditioner sector 
				to monitor compliance with these standards; to harness feedback from stakeholders and solicit their buy-in regarding the new energy performance standards 
				proposed for air conditioner standards."
He further elaborated that the workshop would include paper presentations covering various aspects of air conditioner market monitoring,
				verification, and evaluation in Nigeria. Topics will include but are not limited to, energy efficiency calculation for air conditioners, application of
				ISO 16358-1:2013 on seasonal energy performance, Product Registration System (PRS), and market surveillance for labeling and verification testing.
Highlighting the relevance of the project, Dr Abdullahi emphasised the well-known and felt negative impact of climate change. He underscored 
				the project''s importance in contributing to one of the NDC''s targets, aiming for a 2.5 per cent per year reduction in energy intensity through energy efficiency
				best practices across all sectors of the nation''s economy.
The DG ECN recalled that the Air Conditioner Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) were first approved in Nigeria in 2017 but were 
				scarcely enforced due to various reasons, including the lack of equipment for verification testing by the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON). With support
				from GIZ and the EU, this barrier has been addressed, and an air conditioner biometric testing facility has been procured for SON. The project also proposes 
				a periodic review (every 5 years) of existing air conditioner MEPS to incorporate technological advancements.
The ECN boss affirmed that the outcomes of this training workshop would complement ongoing efforts to strengthen the capacity of government 
				agencies concerned with market surveillance and the enforcement of air conditioner MEPS. The targeted participants include agencies such as the Standards 
				Organisation of Nigeria (SON), National Environmental Standards and Regulatory Enforcement Agency, Nigeria Customs Service, National Ozone Office, Federal 
				Ministry of Environment, Energy Commission of Nigeria and the NESP Team.
He urged all participants to view the training as an opportunity to contribute to the implementation of the revised NDC for a better environment.

				on Sunday at the closing session of the 13th Assembly of the international organisation.
Director General of the Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN), Prof. Eli Jidere Bala, who was present at the event lauded the development, 
				especially at the time that the country is pushing towards energy transition. Apart from bringing Nigeria to the forefront of global discussion and decision-making
				in terms of cleaner energy, Bala said the development would enable the country to discuss finance and investment into renewable energy at the international stage.

The 13th session of the Assembly, which brought together the 168 membership countries equally appointed the incumbent Director-General,
				Francesco La Camera for a second term of four years.
The IRENA Members also agreed on the Agency’s Medium-Term Strategy (MTS) till 2027, a development which would allow the agency to focus on 
				urgent and targeted action, unparalleled international cooperation, and continuous innovation.
La Camera said: “We must build a new energy system with the tools and systems of the future, not the past. Just as we innovate to improve 
				technologies, we must innovate to reimagine international cooperation for the new energy era.
“A renewables-based transition is a vehicle for climate-proof energy systems, improved energy security, reduced inequality and long-overdue 
				universal access. I am deeply humbled to have been appointed for a new term as Director-General. I will continue to work tirelessly to realise IRENA’s new global
				mission.”
Meanwhile, the United Nations earlier asked countries across the world to triple energy transition investment to $4 trillion a year despite the 
				global energy crisis due to Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine.
This is coming as global energy leaders gathered yesterday at the 13th Assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab 
				Emirates to dialogue on options and assess progress on climate change ahead of the Conference of the Parties (COP 28) later this year.
To save the planet, countries across the world, including Nigeria have committed to net-zero goals but prevailing development, especially COVID-19 and the 
				Ukraine war have thrown global projections off balance with serious energy and supply chain disruption.
The resolution for members of IRENA hinted on Short-term actions would accelerate the energy transition in the coming years and course correct the 1.5°C pathway
				to 2050.
Secretary-General António Guterres said at the event that projected 2.8 degrees of global warming by the end of the century remained disastrous, adding that there
				was a need to remove intellectual property barriers and treat key renewable technologies, including energy storage, as global public goods. Calling for
				diversification and increased access to supply chains for raw materials and components for renewables technologies, Guterres said decision-makers must grant approval
				for sustainable projects.
According to him, subsidies must shift from fossil fuels to clean and affordable energy “The price of renewable technologies can be seven times higher in developing
				countries. We must all work together to reduce the capital cost for renewables – and ensure that financing flows to those who need it most. Multilateral Development
				Banks must play their part by investing massively in renewable energy infrastructure, taking on more risks, and leveraging private finance, ” he stated.
The energy leaders from governments, the private sector and international organisations, who gathered insisted that the world is not on track to reach climate and 
				development goals. IRENA’s Director-General Francesco La Camera stated that renewables-based energy transitions could be a powerful force for positive change.
“The intersecting crises we face demand concerted global action, grounded in multilateralism, to emerge stronger and more unified in achieving
				our common goals. And the IRENA Assembly provides a platform to drive a global energy agenda. I firmly believe that your insights, thoughts, and experiences will
				not only guide the Agency’s work in the coming period but also convey to audiences around the world that transforming the global energy system is a path that 
				leads to resilience, equality and prosperity,” he said.

Nearly 60 per cent of Nigeria’s energy demand in 2050 can be met with renewable energy sources, saving 40 per cent in natural gas and 65 per cent
				in oil needs at the same time, according to a new report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
With a growing population and a range of socioeconomic challenges, Nigeria requires sustainable energy sources to meet the growing needs for all
				the sectors of its economy and achieve universal access to modern energy services.
Renewable Energy Roadmap for Nigeria, REMap, developed in collaboration with the Energy Commission of Nigeria, demonstrates how renewable energy
				technologies are key to achieving a sustainable energy mix and meeting the country’s growing needs.
”By using its abundant, untapped renewables”, IRENA’s Director-General Francesco La Camera said, “Nigeria can provide sustainable energy for all
				its citizens in a cost-effective manner. Nigeria has a unique opportunity to develop a sustainable energy system based on renewables that support socioeconomic 
				recovery and development, while addressing climate challenges and accomplishing energy security.”
Dr. Adeleke Olorunimbe Mamora, Nigeria’s Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation added: “The highly distributed institutional structure 
				of the energy sector in Nigeria means that coordination of policies will be essential to unlocking integrated energy transition planning and ensuring its success. 
				A cross cutting agency or body tasked with doing so would be helpful in building consensus and developing a coherent plan which in turn would allow for the scaling
				up of renewable energy to meet the needs across the Nigerian energy sector.”

Investment in renewables will be more cost-effective than the conventional pathway. IRENA’s Energy Transition Scenario has lower investment 
				costs than planned policies, 1.22 trillion USD compared to 1.24 trillion USD respectively. This corresponds to 35 billion USD versus 36 billion USD per year 
				respectively.

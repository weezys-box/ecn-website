				a crucial meeting workshop of theTechnical Working Group (TWG) on Industrial Energy Efficiency (IEE). The discussions, which were of utmost importance, focused
				on strengthening policies and regulatory frameworks to drive the adoption of UNIDO’s Energy Management Systems Standards (EnMS/ESO/ISO 50001) across industries,
				reinforcing Nigeria’s commitment to a more energy-efficient and sustainable future.
This initiative builds on a series of engagements that began with a National Stakeholders’ Workshop in January 2022, where the UNIDO-GEF project
				was introduced and Nigeria’s energy policies were thoroughly reviewed. A follow-up capacity-building workshop in August 2023 equipped key stakeholders with the
				necessary expertise to refine and implement IEE policies and regulations.
As the project advances, key achievements have been made, including developing a Compendium of IEE Policies and Regulations as a strategic 
				reference for industrial energy policies. A critical assessment of Nigeria’s industrial energy sector has also identified policy gaps, ensuring necessary reforms 
				are implemented to enhance energy efficiency. An energy consumption database has been established for key industries to support data-driven decision-making,
				providing insights that drive future policies. Introducing ISO 50001-based Energy Management Systems in select industries has further strengthened Nigeria’s 
				commitment to global energy efficiency standards. At the same time, customised training programs have equipped sectors and government agencies with the skills 
				needed to implement sustainable energy management practices effectively.
As the project nears completion, today’s meeting marked an essential step in establishing a National Inter-Agency Committee. This committee, 
				which is of utmost importance, will provide strategic direction and ensure alignment with national development priorities. It will be crucial in driving policy
				implementation and accelerating industrial energy efficiency adoption by enhancing collaboration across ministries, departments, and agencies.
The Energy Commission of Nigeria, led by Dr Mustapha Abdullahi, CEng MIMechE and guided by its Board Chairman, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu,
				GCFR, remains dedicated to promoting sustainable industrial energy practices and strengthening Nigeria’s energy efficiency framework. Through continued engagement
				with stakeholders, policymakers, and industry leaders, ECN is confident that this initiative will significantly contribute to Nigeria’s long-term energy security,
				industrial growth, and economic development.
